This repository contains all the components of the data science module for Saint Anselm College's PS/CS 211: Remote Sensing and Goucher College's BIO 1-2: Explorations in Biology I: Life in Context.  Click the icon next to the course name above to download the entire module.

## Primary Objective

The primary objective for this module is to provide students an opportunity to create and test a hypothesis about their area of study in land-use or biology without requiring data skills.

## Student Expectations
Both PS/CS 211 and BIO 102 are introductory courses, so no prerequisites are expected of students for this module. Students of PS/CS 211 likely have taken some other computer science classes, and students of BIO 102 may have taken other biology classes.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Interpret and describe data detailing biological factors in nature to understand what each value and its units mean in context
2.  Create and evaluate a hypothesis about an interaction between land-use data and population data using Principal Component Analysis to reduce factors and then a k-means test to classify groups of data
3.  Interpret and draw conclusions from plots of data to make decisions about the trend of a biological interaction, and whether it is beneficial or detrimental
