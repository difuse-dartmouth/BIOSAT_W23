## Module Objective

Provide students an opportunity to create and test a hypothesis about their area of study in land-use or biology without requiring data skills.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Interpret and describe data detailing biological factors in nature to understand what each value and its units mean in context
2.  Create and evaluate a hypothesis about an interaction between land-use data and population data using Principal Component Analysis to reduce factors and then a k-means test to classify groups of data
3.  Interpret and draw conclusions from plots of data to make decisions about the trend of a biological interaction, and whether it is beneficial or detrimental 

## Module Description 
These courses intersect in the interactions between anthropological land use and the ecosystems that develop on that land. This module teaches data analysis and visualization on a data set in this domain: land use in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, and New Hampshire, and basic weather data, White-Tailed Deer Population, and the incidence of Lyme disease. Students are introduced to the data set and the goals of analysis in the pre-lab, and then are walked through the data in table format, map format, and PCA and k-means plots in the main lab assignment. These plots are interactively produced through the use of a Google Colab file running python script, while the lab and pre-lab assignments are Canvas quizzes which live in Canvas Commons.

## Course Information
Professor Guerra's course, [Remote Sensing](http://catalog.anselm.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=8&coid=10289), introduces students to working with ArcGIS and processing satellite imagery. Professor Garaycochea's course, [Explorations in Biology I](https://catalog.goucher.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=21262), introduces students to biological and ecological interactions. These are introductory courses, so no prerequisites are expected of students for this module. Students of PS/CS 211 likely have taken some other computer science classes, and students of BIO 102 may have taken other biology classes.
